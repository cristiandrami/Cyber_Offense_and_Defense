1) first we can see that if the username is not present, in fact if we try to perform the login with pippo we obtain in the response wrong username

2) so we can fuzz the post request with the username wordlist until we obtain incorrect password
    the valid username in this case is athena

3) after getting the username we can fuzz the password field in the post with the password wordlist.
in this case the password is mustang
