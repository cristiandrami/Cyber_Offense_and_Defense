1) perform the login with wiener:peter

2) when we put the security 2fa code we cna see that in the request is sent a cookie verify=wiener

3) so we can try to fuzz the request changing verify to verify=carlos and fuzzing the code with the wordlist codes.txt

4) we can see that when the code is correct the body of the response is of size 0 because we have a redirect

5) with the found code and changing verify to carlos we can access as carlos
