On the login form we can put in the username:
brucewayne' -- 
here we can see that is possible to perform the login as brucewayne

We want to get the credit card of brucewayne so we can use first the fuzzer to understand the length of credit card.
We can send the first request with;
brucewayne' and length(credit_card)=1 --
if we fuzz the "1" from 1 to 25 for example, we can say that the length is 16 from the responses


now we know the length so we want to extract one by one the digits of the credit card

We start from 
brucewayne' and SUBSTRING(credit_card, 1, 1) ='1' --

here we can fuzz the first 1 in the substring function (from 1 to 16 that is the length of the credit card) and the '1' in the = from 0 to 9 that are the possible digits
