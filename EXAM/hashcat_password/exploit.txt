Use the rockyou.txt file to brute force the following password hashes (1 point each): c51e7a23a59ef8d76892f207b517eaf0, $2a$09$aJUc7jD71mV.KbWgyO2zweLWyUYoxHb8G/LsGXFgjfx9ynqusxUtO, $1$NOcJM.4s$kIKttixk75d7wgMqDjyYK..

The first and second passwords are among the first 1000 lines of rockyou.txt. The third password is also among the first 1000 lines of rockyou.txt, but it was modified to have the format COD{original-password}.






we can use hashcat and rockyou wordlist to crack these hashes

1) c51e7a23a59ef8d76892f207b517eaf0 we need to understand which is the hashing function so we do 
hashcat -a 0 c51e7a23a59ef8d76892f207b517eaf0 '/home/cristian/Scrivania/wordlists/rockyou.txt' --force


And i get some hints were there is MD5 (0) so to crack it we need to do 
hashcat -a 0 -m 0 c51e7a23a59ef8d76892f207b517eaf0 '/home/cristian/Scrivania/wordlists/rockyou.txt' --force

MY COMPUTER DOESN'T ALLOW ME TO EXECUTE HASHCAT FOR GPU DRIVERS ERRORS. But on https://hashtoolkit.com/decrypt-hash/?hash=c51e7a23a59ef8d76892f207b517eaf0 we can see that is the original value is millie




2) $2a$09$aJUc7jD71mV.KbWgyO2zweLWyUYoxHb8G/LsGXFgjfx9ynqusxUtO we need to understand which is the hashing function so we do 
hashcat -a 0 "\$2a\$09\$aJUc7jD71mV.KbWgyO2zweLWyUYoxHb8G/LsGXFgjfx9ynqusxUtO" '/home/cristian/Scrivania/wordlists/rockyou.txt' --force


And i get some hints were there is bcrypt (3200) so we need to do 
hashcat -a 0 -m 3200 "\$2a\$09\$aJUc7jD71mV.KbWgyO2zweLWyUYoxHb8G/LsGXFgjfx9ynqusxUtO" '/home/cristian/Scrivania/wordlists/rockyou.txt' --force

We need to add \ because $ is a bash char so we have to escape it
MY COMPUTER DOESN'T ALLOW ME TO EXECUTE HASHCAT FOR GPU DRIVERS ERRORS. so i don't know the original value of the hash



3) $1$NOcJM.4s$kIKttixk75d7wgMqDjyYK. we need to understand which is the hashing function so we do 
hashcat -a 0 "\$1\$NOcJM.4s\$kIKttixk75d7wgMqDjyYK." '/home/cristian/Scrivania/wordlists/rockyou.txt' --force

Now here we have to write a python script that changes all first 1000 line of rockyou from "line" to "COD{line}"

And i get a hint that is md5crypt (500)
hashcat -a 0 -m 500 "\$1\$NOcJM.4s\$kIKttixk75d7wgMqDjyYK." '/home/cristian/Scrivania/wordlists/rockyou.txt' --force

We need to add \ because $ is a bash char so we have to escape it
MY COMPUTER DOESN'T ALLOW ME TO EXECUTE HASHCAT FOR GPU DRIVERS ERRORS. so i don't know the original value of the hash
