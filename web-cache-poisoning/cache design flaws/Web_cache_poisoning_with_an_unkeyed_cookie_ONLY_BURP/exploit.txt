1) when we see the first request and the response the server sends us a response that contains set-cookie with a cookie for the cache
2) from the next times we perform the request we will send this cookie and it is reflected into a script in double quotes 
data = {
                "host":"0a0900ce03921665813311cb00be0096.web-security-academy.net",
                "path":"/",
                "frontend":"REFLECTED"
            }
3) we can see that when the cache expires (30 sec) and we change the cookie we sent it is reflected and stored in the cache because it is not used as key
4) so if we insert as cookie "-alert(1)-" we are able to obtain:
data = {
                "host":"0a0900ce03921665813311cb00be0096.web-security-academy.net",
                "path":"/",
                "frontend":"-alert(1)-"
            }

that is triggered in javascript.

the game is done
