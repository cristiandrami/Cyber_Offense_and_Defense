This lab contains a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability in the comment functionality. To solve this lab, submit a comment that calls the alert function when the comment author name is clicked.

1) write a comment for a post and see that the website is reflected into an href in the author name 
    <a id="author" href="www.google.it">sss</a>

2) so we could try to inject javascript:alert() in the website field that is reflected into href attribute (href allows this inline javascript code)
    so we will have
    <a id="author" href="javascript:alert()">sss</a>

3) if we click on the author name then the alert() is triggered
