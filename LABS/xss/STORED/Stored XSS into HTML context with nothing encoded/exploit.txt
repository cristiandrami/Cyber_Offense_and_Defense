This lab contains a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability in the comment functionality.

To solve this lab, submit a comment that calls the alert function when the blog post is viewed.

1) go on the homepage, search for a post and write a comment on it
2) in comment insert  <b> comment </b> and see that the resulting text is bold 
3) try
    <script> alert() </script>
4) if we refresh the page we will have the alert
