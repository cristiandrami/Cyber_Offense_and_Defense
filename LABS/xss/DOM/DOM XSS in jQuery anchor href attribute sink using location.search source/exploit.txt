This lab contains a DOM-based cross-site scripting vulnerability in the submit feedback page. It uses the jQuery library's $ selector function to find an anchor element, and changes its href attribute using data from location.search.

To solve this lab, make the "back" link alert document.cookie.



1) go on the feedback page and see that the parameter ?returnPath is reflected in the link < back

2) it is reflected using jQuery (See source page or the response in ZAP)
    <script>
        $(function() {
            $('#backLink').attr("href", (new URLSearchParams(window.location.search)).get('returnPath'));
        });
    </script>

    so we can try to inject a inline javascript code

    ?returnPath=javascript:alert()

    it works but we cannot see the alert because the browser blocks it
