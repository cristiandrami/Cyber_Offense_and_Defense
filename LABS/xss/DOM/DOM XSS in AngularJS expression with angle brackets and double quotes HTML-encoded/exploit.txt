This lab contains a DOM-based cross-site scripting vulnerability in a AngularJS expression within the search functionality.

AngularJS is a popular JavaScript library, which scans the contents of HTML nodes containing the ng-app attribute (also known as an AngularJS directive). When a directive is added to the HTML code, you can execute JavaScript expressions within double curly braces. This technique is useful when angle brackets are being encoded.

To solve this lab, perform a cross-site scripting attack that executes an AngularJS expression and calls the alert function.




1) when we perform a search we can see that it is reflected in the page and we can also see from ZAP and from the requests that angular is used
2) when we perform a request then the search is reflected into the body that has the property ng-app
    so angular allows to execute code when a node i sng-app using this directive
    
    {{}}

3) inject 
    ?search={{$on.constructor('alert()')()}}

    the browser doesn't show the alert but it works
