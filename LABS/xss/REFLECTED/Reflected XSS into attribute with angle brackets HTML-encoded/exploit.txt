This lab contains a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability in the search blog functionality where angle brackets are HTML-encoded. To solve this lab, perform a cross-site scripting attack that injects an attribute and calls the alert function.

1) perform a search ah see that the value seaerched is reflected into the page

2) in addition if we search into the source page for the searched string then we can see it is reflected into a tag attribute 
        <input type="text" placeholder="Search the blog..." name="search" value="hello">

3) but we can see that if we try to inject < and > to break the tag they are escaped
    
    so we can try to inject an attribute in it for the event onmouseover

4) inject in the search input 
    " onmouseover=alert() x="

    in this way we are abel to convert the input into:

    <input type="text" placeholder="Search the blog..." name="search" value="" onmouseover=alert() x=" ">

4) when we move the mouse on the input it will trigger the alert()
