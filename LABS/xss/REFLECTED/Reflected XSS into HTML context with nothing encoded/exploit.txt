This lab contains a simple reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability in the search functionality.

To solve the lab, perform a cross-site scripting attack that calls the alert function.


1) go on the homepage and search for something, you can see that what you search is reflected 
2) search for <b> test </b> and see that the reflected is bold 
3) try
    <script> alert() </script>
