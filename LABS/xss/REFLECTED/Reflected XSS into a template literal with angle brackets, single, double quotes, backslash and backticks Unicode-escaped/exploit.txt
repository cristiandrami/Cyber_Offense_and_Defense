https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/contexts/lab-javascript-template-literal-angle-brackets-single-double-quotes-backslash-backticks-escaped

This lab contains a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability in the search blog functionality. The reflection occurs inside a template string with angle brackets, single, and double quotes HTML encoded, and backticks escaped. To solve this lab, perform a cross-site scripting attack that calls the alert function inside the template string.

1) search fot something like "test" 
2) in the source page you can see that test is reflected into variable of a script
    
    var message = `0 search results for 'test'`;
    document.getElementById('searchMessage').innerText = message;

    so we can see that it uses backticks ``

4) try to inject executable code in this backticks string
    ${alert()}               -> this is the way to use code in backticks

it works
