1) we know that Origin header is used as key for caching so we can use it to perfrom our test
2) in the requests done when we perform GET domain we can see that there is one:
    GET domain/js/geolocate.js?callback=setCountryCookie
    
    so it seems that we are saying that the callback we want to call is the function setCountryCookie
    in fact in the response we obtain setCountryCookie({"country":"United Kingdom"});

3) now we can try to use Origin: test to understand the cache behavior
   we notice that if we put in the body of the GET request:
   callback=aaa

   it is reflected in the response and it is stored in cache, so if we request a normal GET domain/js/geolocate.js?callback=setCountryCookie we will obtain in response aaa({"country":"United Kingdom"});

4) so we can inject in the GET body:
   callback=alert(1)//

5) we have poisoned the cache
