1) we knwo that Origin header is used as key for caching so we can use it to perfrom our test
2) we can see that when we perform a request with a query string: 
    GET domain/?test=1

    if we send 2 times the request the server will store the response in cache 

3) when the response to GET domain/?test=1 is stored in cache if we perform GET domain  (without query parameter) we get the cached response
    to perform the test we need to set Origin: some_origin_test in order to understand how the cache works (otherwise we have to wait 40 sec each test)

4) we can see that when the response to GET domain/?test=1 is stored in cache, in the response ?test=1 is reflected into a tag <link rel="canonical" href="domain/?test=1">

5) we can try to use as parameter ?test='><script>alert(1)</script>   (url encoded)

6) the game is done
