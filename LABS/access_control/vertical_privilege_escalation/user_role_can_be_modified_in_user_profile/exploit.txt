This lab has an admin panel at /admin. It's only accessible to logged-in users with a roleid of 2.
You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter


1) login as wiener:peter and try to access to /admin
    it is not possible because our roleid is 1

2) try to change the email of wiener and see that the request contains a JSON in the body
    {"email":"aaa@it.it"}

3) try to add to this JSON "roleid": 2 to see if also the role id is changed
    {"email":"aaa@it.it", "roleid": 2}

4) it allows us to become administrator and access /admin

5) delete carlos
