This lab has an unprotected admin panel. It's located at an unpredictable location, but the location is disclosed somewhere in the application.

Solve the lab by accessing the admin panel, and using it to delete the user carlos.



1) go to the login page and look at the page source
    we cna see that there is a script for users registered admins that redirects them to the admin panel 

2) copy the endpoint of the scipt and access to the unprotected admin panel
       adminPanelTag.setAttribute('href', '/admin-8fnkdz');
       so /admin-8fnkdz
