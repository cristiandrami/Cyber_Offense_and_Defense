This lab has a horizontal privilege escalation vulnerability on the user account page.

To solve the lab, obtain the API key for the user carlos and submit it as the solution.


1) log in as wiener:peter
2) in my-account section we can see that the url is formed in this way:
    /my-account?id=wiener

3) try to change the url into 
    /my-account?id=carlos

    we can have the access to carlos profile

4) copy the API key of carlos
