This lab contains an access control vulnerability where sensitive information is leaked in the body of a redirect response.

To solve the lab, obtain the API key for the user carlos and submit it as the solution.

You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter



1) access as wiener:peter
2) in my-account section we can see that the url is formed in this way:
    /my-account?id=wiener

3) change it to 
    /my-account?id=carlos

    BUT we are redirected to the login page

4) open ZAP and look what happens, so don't follow the redirect, we can see that the first response we obtain contains carlos profile and we can seee
    <div>Your API Key is: eyzWPrRAlO5QL57SYKPjOV9UNdalFUF4</div><br/>

    after this we are redirected to the login page

5) use the API key of carlos
