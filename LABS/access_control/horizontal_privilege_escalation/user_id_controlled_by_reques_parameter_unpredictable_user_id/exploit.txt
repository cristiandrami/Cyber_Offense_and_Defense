This lab has a horizontal privilege escalation vulnerability on the user account page.

To solve the lab, obtain the API key for the user carlos and submit it as the solution.


1) log in as wiener:peter
2) in my-account section we can see that the url is formed in this way:
    /my-account?id=uuid_wiener

3) so to see carlos profile we need to obtain the uuid of carlos
4) go on post section and see the comments, find one of carlos and click on
    carlos name, we are redirected to the public profile of carlos 

    here we can notice that there is the uuid of carlos in the url 
    /blogs?userId=32995041-ea86-41f9-84e1-483953522622


3) so access to carlos private profile with
    /my-account?id=32995041-ea86-41f9-84e1-483953522622



4) copy the API key of carlos
