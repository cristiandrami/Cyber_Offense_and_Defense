This lab has user account page that contains the current user's existing password, prefilled in a masked input.

To solve the lab, retrieve the administrator's password, then use it to delete the user carlos.

You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter


1) log in as wiener:peter and in the account page we can see that there is the password field that is prefilled

2) we can also notice that the url is formed in this way:
    /my-account?id=wiener

3) change it to /my-account?id=administrator
    there is the password field of the admin prefilled, so with the ispection f12 we can easily see the value of the field
    we copy it 

4) access to administrator profile with the leaked password
