This lab stores user chat logs directly on the server's file system, and retrieves them using static URLs.

Solve the lab by finding the password for the user carlos, and logging into their account.

1) go on Live chat and click on download transcript

2) on ZAP we can see that the download is done with a GET request to /download-transcript/3.txt, so we can try to download the trascript of other users changing the endpoint

    /download-transcript/2.txt
    /download-transcript/1.txt

    in 1.txt we can see that there is a chat between carlos and the support in which we can find the password

3) log in with the leaked password ac62xfgc7ask9n1dgx73
