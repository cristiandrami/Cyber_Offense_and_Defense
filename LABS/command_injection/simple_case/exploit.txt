This lab contains an OS command injection vulnerability in the product stock checker.


1) open ZAP and look at the POST request to  /product/stock 

2) try to inject command whoami in the body, so conveet it in
    productId=3&storeId=2 | whoami

    we can see that the response is peter-9by8hF

   so | is used to concatenate multiple commands and execute a pipeline
