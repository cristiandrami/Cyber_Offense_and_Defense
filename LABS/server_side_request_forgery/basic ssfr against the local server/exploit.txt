This lab has a stock check feature which fetches data from an internal system.

To solve the lab, change the stock check URL to access the admin interface at http://localhost/admin and delete the user carlos.

1) try to access to /admin
    we can read that the access is enabled only for administrators and from localhost

2) perform a request to see if a product is in the stock to  POST /product/stock

    we can see that this performs a request to an API 

    so change the endpoint of the api in the body to:
    stockAPI=http://localhost/admin

    and we obtain the admin panel

3) here we can see that /delete?username=carlos is used to delete carlos so basically we send another POST to /product/stock with this body
    stockApi=http://localhost/admin/delete?username=carlos
