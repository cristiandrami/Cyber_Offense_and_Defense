This lab has a stock check feature which fetches data from an internal system.

To solve the lab, use the stock check functionality to scan the internal 192.168.0.X range for an admin interface on port 8080, then use it to delete the user carlos.

1) try to access to /admin
   we cna rwead that is not found

2) perform a request to see if a product is in the stock to  POST /product/stock

    we can see that this performs a request to an API using a specific IP (we know that the back end is on an IP between 192.168.0.1:8080 and 192.168.0.254:8080

    so change the endpoint of the api in the body to:
    stockAPI=http://192.168.0.0:8080
    
    BUT we obtain Inteernal error server, so maybe the IP is another one 

    so we fuzz the X in http://192.168.0.X:8080 from 1 to 254

    and we obtain a 404 error only on ip 192.168.0.136:8080


3) so we can access to the admin panel changing the POST body to /product/stock to
    stockApi=http://192.168.0.136:8080/admin

4) here we can see that /delete?username=carlos is used to delete carlos so basically we send another POST to /product/stock with this body
    stockApi=http://192.168.0.136:8080/admin/delete?username=carlos
