1) perform the login as wiener:peter
2) try to change the password 
    1) if we put the correct current password and the 2 new passwords match then it is changed
    2) if we put a wrong current password and the 2 new passwords match then it logs us out
    3) if we put the wrong current password and 2 new passwords don't match then it prints "New passwrods don't match"
    4) if we put the wrong current password and 2 new passwords match then it prints "current password is wrong"

3) so get the request with 2 new passwords different
    1) change username to carlos
    2) fuzz current password with the wordlist
4) look at the responses, one has a different body size, and contains "New passwrods don't match" so we get valid the current password

5) use the extracted password to log in as carlos
