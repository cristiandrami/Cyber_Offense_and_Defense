1) access as wiener:peter using stay logged in 

2) if we decode the stay-logged-in cookie we can see that it is formed by:
    base64( username + ':' + md5Hash( password ) ) 

3) so what we can do is to construct a wordlist formed by base64( carlos + ':' + md5Hash( password ) ) where password is taken by a password wordlist (passwords.txt)

4) go to the account get request and fuzz the stay logged in cookie
    1) add all passwords as string
    2) add a preprocessor MD5 hashing 
    3) copy the result of the preprocessor and paste it in a txt file

    4) from terminal add the prefix carlos: to all rows of the txt file
        awk '{print "carlos:"$0}' password_hashed_md5.txt > username_and_password_hashed.txt

    5) put all rows in the fuzzer string add add a preprocessor base64 
    6) copy all new rows in a txt file

    7) finally fuzz the stay logged in cookie with the lines of the final txt file
    
REMEMBER: you have to remove the session cookie, otherwise it will log in always as wiener

look at the responses and get the response with code 200
revert the stay logged in cookie and see the password
