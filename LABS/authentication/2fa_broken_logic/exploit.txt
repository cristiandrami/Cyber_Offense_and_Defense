1) perform the login with wiener:peter

2) when we put the security 2fa code we can see that in the request is sent a cookie verify=wiener
     so first of all we force the code sending to carlos perfromin a get request to 
        lab.net/login2
        with cookie verify=carlos
    so resent GET to /login2 with verify=carlos to create the cde for carlos

3) so we can try to fuzz the request changing verify to verify=carlos and fuzzing the code with the wordlist codes.txt
    this on the POST request /login2
    fuzzing mfa-code 

4) we can see that when the code is correct the body of the response is of size 0 because we have a redirect

5) with the found code and changing verify to carlos we can access as carlos
