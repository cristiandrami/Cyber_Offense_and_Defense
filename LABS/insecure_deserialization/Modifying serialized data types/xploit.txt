This lab uses a serialization-based session mechanism and is vulnerable to authentication bypass as a result. To solve the lab, edit the serialized object in the session cookie to access the administrator account. Then, delete the user carlos.

You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter


1) access as wiener:peter and see that the session cookie is a serialized object in base64
    O:4:"User":2:{s:8:"username";s:6:"wiener";s:12:"access_token";s:32:"tzphtigo7v9fe86b42jy1hf6gcbwoeif";}

2) we can see that it is a PHP serialized object so we could leverage to loose comparison operator, so try
    a) change the username to a string of 13 chars (administrator) so s:13:"administrator"
    b) change the access token to a int and give the value 0
        if the code is vulnerable to loose comparison then when it's going to check "administrator_token" == 0 it will return true because strings are considered as integer 0


    O:4:"User":2:{s:8:"username";s:13:"administrator";s:12:"access_token";i:0;}

3) it works and we are now administrators

4) delete carlos
