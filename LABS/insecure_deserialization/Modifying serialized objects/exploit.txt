This lab uses a serialization-based session mechanism and is vulnerable to privilege escalation as a result. To solve the lab, edit the serialized object in the session cookie to exploit this vulnerability and gain administrative privileges. Then, delete the user carlos.

You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter



1) login as wiener:peter nd see that there is a session cookie
    if we decode it in base64 we can see that it is a serialized object that has this form:
    O:4:"User":2:{s:8:"username";s:6:"wiener";s:5:"admin";b:0;}

2) change the boolean admin to 1 
    O:4:"User":2:{s:8:"username";s:6:"wiener";s:5:"admin";b:1;}

3) encode it in base64 and use this new value as session cookie
4) we become admin and we can delete carlos
