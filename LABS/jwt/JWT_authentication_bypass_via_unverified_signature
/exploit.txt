https://portswigger.net/web-security/jwt/lab-jwt-authentication-bypass-via-unverified-signature

This lab uses a JWT-based mechanism for handling sessions. Due to implementation flaws, the server doesn't verify the signature of any JWTs that it receives.

To solve the lab, modify your session token to gain access to the admin panel at /admin, then delete the user carlos.

You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter


1) perform the login with wiener:peter
2) each one request from now will contain a session cookie that is a jwt

3) try to access the /admin page
    we can only access if we are administrator

4) go to https://token.dev/ and paste the session cookie

5) change in the payload sub from wiener to administrator
6) copy the new token and paste it in the session cookie in the browser
7) access to /admin page and delete carlos

N.T This works because the signature is not considered on the site so we are able to bypass the authentication as admin without giving a valid signature.


Alternatively use base64 from terminal or the .sh or .py file in this folder
