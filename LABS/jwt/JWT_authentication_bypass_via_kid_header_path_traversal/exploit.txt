1) using burp, install JWT editor from extensions
2) go to JWT editor panel and create New Symmetric key and click on generate
3) change k parameter to "AA=="
    AA== is null byte encoded in base64
4) perform the login with wiener:peter
5) go to /my-account and send it to the repeter
6) from the repeter go to JSON web token section
7) change sub from wiener to administrator
8) change kid to "../../../../dev/null"
9) click on bottom on "sign" and use the key generated before
10) copy the new token and paste it in session cookie in the browser
11) go to /admin and delete carlos


It works because the server will use ../../../../dev/null to sign the token but it returns a null byte that is equal to the one we used before
