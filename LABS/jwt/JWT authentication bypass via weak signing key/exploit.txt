https://portswigger.net/web-security/jwt/lab-jwt-authentication-bypass-via-weak-signing-key

This lab uses a JWT-based mechanism for handling sessions. It uses an extremely weak secret key to both sign and verify tokens. This can be easily brute-forced using a wordlist of common secrets.

To solve the lab, first brute-force the website's secret key. Once you've obtained this, use it to sign a modified session token that gives you access to the admin panel at /admin, then delete the user carlos.

You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter


1) access as wiener:peter and copy the jwt stored in session cookie
2) use cracker.py to crack it using wordlist.txt
    python3 cracker.py wordlist -w wordlist.txt "JWT TOKEN"

    in this case the password is secret1

3) go on burp in JWT Editor and add a NEW symmetric key 
    specify the secret obtained with cracker.py

    so in this case Specify secret: secret1 and generate

4) go on burp and send /my-account request to repeater, go on JWT section and change wiener with administrator and sign with the symmetric key generated before

5) copy the token and put it in the browser, access to /admin and delete carlos
