1) perform an order to understand the flow of the website

2) we can see that when we perform an order using a post request to POST /cart/checkout if the credit is sufficent the website performs a request to 
    GET /cart/order-confirmation?order-confirmed=true

3) now insert in the cart a jacket (1337) 
    if we try to do a post request to /cart/checkout we obtain an error (credits not sufficient)
    BUT

4) if we directly perform a GET to  /cart/order-confirmation?order-confirmed=true then the order is placed and we obtain the jacket
