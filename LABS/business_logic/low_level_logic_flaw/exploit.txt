32123 units of jackets -> 324 requests with units 99 and 1 with units 47
65 of hitch a lift



we want to buy a free jacket

1) this application has this type of problem:
    when the price of a product exceeds the maximum value permitted for an integer in the back-end programming language ( in this case 2,147,483,647), the value is looped back around to the minimum possible value (-2,147,483,648)

2) so we need to take a number of jackets uch that the total price turn back between 0 and 100

3) if we send 324 requests with 99 units and 1 request with 47 for the jacket we reach a price of -$1221.96
    for 324 requests use the fuzzer on the adding a jacket request (see fuzz.txt)
    remember to cleaer the cart before doing it

4) we can add now 65 hitch a lift to take the price to 40
