This lab uses an OAuth service to allow users to log in with their social media account. Flawed validation by the client application makes it possible for an attacker to log in to other users' accounts without knowing their password.

To solve the lab, log in to Carlos's account. His email address is carlos@carlos-montoya.net.

You can log in with your own social media account using the following credentials: wiener:peter.



1) perform the login as wiener:peter
2) with ZAP look at the Oauth flow, we can see that after the Oauth, the authentication on the website is done sending in back-end with a POST and a JSON containing username, email and token
        POST /authenticate

3) delete each cookie and perform another time the authentication with wiener:peter
4) intercept the requestes and when we reach POST /authenticate then change 
    email to carlos@carlos-montoya.net and username to carlos
    Don't canhe the token

4 the server responds with a Set-Cookie session that is the session cookie of Carlos



DONE!!!
