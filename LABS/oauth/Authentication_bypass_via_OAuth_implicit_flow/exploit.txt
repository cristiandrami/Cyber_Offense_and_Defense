1 perform the login as wiener
2 with ZAP look at the Oauth flow, we can see that after the Oauth, the authentication on the website is done sending in back-end with a POST and a JSON containing username, email and token
        POST /authenticate
3 change the username and email with carlos and carlos@carlos-montoya.net but not the token (don't follow the redirect)
4 the server responds with a Set-Cookie session that is the session cookie of Carlos

DONE!!!
