1) try to access to lab.net/admin
    we can notice that the access is permitted only to local users so to users that have a local IP address

2) if we use TRACE method on /admin we can see that the server appends an header with our IP address
        X-Custom-IP-Authorization: 87.21.26.193

3) so we try to access /admin using 
    X-Custom-IP-Authorization: 127.0.0.1
    
    and it is ok, we are able to see the page


4) try to delete carlos account using /admin/delete?username=carlos using
    X-Custom-IP-Authorization: 127.0.0.1
    
    (we can see the end point on the page /admin -> in the button delete) 

5) it's done
