This lab is vulnerable to server-side template injection due to the way an object is being passed into the template. This vulnerability can be exploited to access sensitive data.

To solve the lab, steal and submit the framework's secret key.

You can log in to your own account using the following credentials:

content-manager:C0nt3ntM4n4g3r



1) log in as content-manager:C0nt3ntM4n4g3r

2) change the template of a product from the homepage to:
    ${{<%[%'"}}%\
    
    we can see if they are processed or not by the template engine

3) we can see that an error shows us that it is used DJANGO

4) inject the built in 
    {% debug %}
    and see that there is an object settings, in the documentation we can see that it contains a SECRET_KEY

5) inject 
    {{settings.SECRET_KEY}}  in order to retrieve the secret key
