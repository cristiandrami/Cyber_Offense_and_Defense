1) we can notice in the registration that if an user is an admin then his email terminates with @dontwannacry.com

2) in this case we register an account with our exploit email
    attacker@exploit-0a36004e03aac071874c840b01a200aa.exploit-server.net

3) we confirm the registration and we perform the login

4) in the account page we can try to change our email to a random one that contains @dontwannacry.com

    aaa@dontwannacry.com

5) now we are signed as admin and we can use the authorization of the admin
