1) we want ot buy the jacket (1337) but we have onl 100

2) add it to the cart and then try to place the order
    it is not possible to do 

3) go on ZAP and see the requests done and look at the one used to add the jacket in the cart, it contains in the body this:
    productId=1&redir=PRODUCT&quantity=1&price=133700


4) change this body in 
    productId=1&redir=PRODUCT&quantity=1&price=100 
    send the new request (before remove all objects in the cart)

5) go on cart and see that now the price of the jacket is 1, place the order now
    it is allowed
