1) perform the login with wiener:peter
2) each one request from now will contain a session cookie that is a jwt

3) try to access the /admin page
    we can only access if we are administrator

4) go to https://token.dev/ and paste the session cookie

5) change in the payload sub from wiener to administrator
6) change alg from RS256 to none

7) REMEMBER to add the third point after the token

8) copy the new token and paste it in the session cookie in the browser
9) access to /admin page and delete carlos

N.T This works here we can put none as signing algorithm so the signature is valid


Alternatively use base64 from terminal or the .sh or .py file in this folder
